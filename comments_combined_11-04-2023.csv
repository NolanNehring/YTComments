1szw2f9ENwk,"Hola! Antes que nada, felicitaciones por tu proyecto, lo sigo desde el comienzo y me parece espectacular. Perdón por escribir en español, supongo que puedes traducirlo con el traductor automático de YouTube o con Google Translate.  <br>Me pasa algo muy personal y particular con los gráficos y con la estética de N64. Es difícil de explicar, pero intentaré resumirlo: cuando llegó la N64 a latinoamérica, allá por los años 1997-1998, no entendíamos mucho de especificaciones técnicas, simplemente nos guiábamos por el número de bits de las consolas y por lo que vendían las publicidades. Si bien objetivamente N64 era superior a PlayStation 1 en muchos aspectos (no solo en la cantidad de bits), con el tiempo descubrí las limitaciones del formato cartucho, entre otras cuestiones que dejaban a N64 en desventaja con la ps1. Pero en aquel entonces, para mí N64 era sinónimo de superioridad en todos los aspectos. Entonces, mi mente (y mi corazón, si me lo permiten) hizo una especie de &quot;asociación&quot;, y esa estética tan particular de N64 quedó grabada para siempre en mí como &quot;los mejores gráficos que podrán existir jamás&quot;. Es hasta el día de hoy (2023) que sigo viendo los gráficos de N64, con esa &quot;borrosidad&quot; tan particular, esa niebla, esas texturas suavizadas, etc., y me siguen pareciendo INCREÍBLES. Obviamente sé que existen gráficos objetiva y técnicamente superiores, como los de la última edición de Xbox, PlayStation o Switch (o cualquier consola que salga en el futuro). Pero (y por eso decía al comienzo que era algo muy personal) para mí los gráficos de N64 siempre serán &quot;superiores&quot;. Superiores para mí, porque me conectan con una época muy feliz de mi vida. Superiores porque eran los gráficos que veía en las vidrieras de los negocios de videojuegos, con la nariz pegada al vidrio, soñando recibir para Navidad el Super Mario 64 o el Ocarina of Time. Superiores porque todavía recuerdo la primera vez que tuve un mando de N64 en mis manos y no podía creer cómo se sentía. Superiores porque veía las publicidades de los juegos en la TV o en revistas y me parecían inalcanzables. Siempre digo que, paradójicamente, fueron aquellas limitaciones de la consola y del formato cartucho (que algunos señalan como puntos negativos) las que dieron como resultado y nos regalaron esa estética tan particular y única que tanto amamos. Larga vida a los gráficos de N64!!! Espero que se haya entendido mi punto. Saludos!","Hola! Antes que nada, felicitaciones por tu proyecto, lo sigo desde el comienzo y me parece espectacular.

N64 used analytical edge AA based on Wu's line algorithm. Arguably it's more precise (at polygon edge AA) than most things done today (when it works). Contrary to popular belief it does not make N64 graphics less clear. To the contrary, it makes them more precise. What makes N64 slightly too blurry is the video interface blur added on top of the frame buffer to hide dither and further soften the parts where the AA did not work so well. That and many games just rendered at lower res and upscaled (what a precursor). Fortunately cheat codes/patches via flashcarts disable the dither filter, because they turn off the N64’s VI unit which is responsible for all post-processing effects. But the edge AA is great. Some devs even experimented doing something similar through shaders at the start of the current gen, but it's quality was restricted by lack of conservative rasterization hardware support. I still have wet dreams in which next gen analythical edge AA becomes a standard feature on next gen and I make sweet love to the TV screen, but I always wake up all exasperated right when things start to get real hot.

At their best N64 games looked significantly better than PS1 games, almost half a generation ahead. You can work around the tiny texture RAM but you just can't substitute for a lack of perspective correction or texture filtering. Lack of sub-pixel correction accuracy was the worst offender though. Lack of decent quality mipmapping/texture filtering, sub-pixel precision and perspective correction is just bad combination. 

I think Star Wars Rogue Leader developer Julian Eggbrecht summed it up perfectly:
""A well done programmed N64 game always looks better than a similar PS1 game"" 

Hooking up my OSSC and going back and playing games on the PS1 is painful. Early N64 games were all really low res, but late games improved drastically and were far superior to that on the PS1, it's not even close.

Edit: Comparision starting at 0:20 is very missleading. While AA is enabled (0:27) so is the VI Unit which is responsible for that fuzzy screenshot. For all you who are wondering how AA on the N64 actually works:
Here's my own take captured with an OSSC (VI off, De-Blur off)

Clever use of the filtering there!

A few things to add: 
- You'll want to turn off shadows, as those are making the video look too modern! Most N64 games just used a dark circle under the character's feet, and maybe shaded certain areas of the map darker using vertex colours as well. A few standouts (e.g., Conker) used shadow maps, but the character models should be the only objects that cast shadows, and they should not be able to receive shadows themselves (Conker's head never casts a shadow across his chest, for example. Only on the environment.)

- The Nintendo 64 could only handle a few thousand triangles at a time: 1-2K for early or low-end games, and 5-10K for some really fancy ones.
If you want to keep the character models, draw distance, etc., really authentic, then hide everything that's not on camera, and see how many triangles are still being drawn.
This is where the tradeoffs come in: if you want a long draw distance, you'll have to keep the detail to a minimum. On the other hand, scripted cutscenes give you a lot of control over what is or isn't displayed, so you can put way more detail into the characters (see Kirby 64).
