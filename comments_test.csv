dfKjgNOwC3Q,I was thinking what if you could run out of food and need to go into town to get food or maybe the merchant might sell ingredients and you can also hire people like a waiter who can give the foods to the customers another thing is if you could buy extra floors and seats. Because customers might wait outside and also have a patients bar so upgrading your bar to be bigger can also be encouraged and not just so that it looks cool. Random people might show up in a specific place and have a icon that can show that he wants and job and when you. Right click him you could get info about him and his stats and also. Seeing  how much he wants to get paid and you can reject him too. In the beginning you might be able to name your bar and real people could look at your bar by typing in the name or maybe a code for your bar and teleport there. You can also add fights randomly and if you let it happen the people in the bar will cheer and come again most likely but if you let it happen a guard in knight armor will stop the fight and give you a few coins the another thing that you can do is add a trash in case you make a mistake and you can throw the accidental food. Another is maybe if you could have a limited amount of bowls and bar cups so you’ll need to buy more with the merchant and you will also need to wash the bar cups and that might be another job you might want someone to have.  You can also add rich people like kings from another kingdom that might have 2 knights by his side and the king will pay more than the average person the last thing I wanted to mention was tips and maybe the better quality the food or drink the more the tip is and maybe the more decorations the more the tip will be also. Sorry for the bad format option when I already did like 5 ideas I already noticed that it would be confusing the next video I might get another idea and I will remember to do it much better so it’s easier to read but anyways I really hope that a few ideas make it into the game and that my ideas are at least thought about,I was thinking what if you could run out of food and need to go into town to get food or maybe the merchant might sell ingredients and you can also hire people like a waiter who can give the foods to the customers another thing is if you could buy extra floors and seats.

wQ7t2FTU2Og,"A way to let the colours influence the game a bit more is through they having actual meaning. Maybe the red one is from an empire and the blue one from a coast port city, so you could add people from different places (if you place the tavern at, say, at an intersection/border between the factions).When a person from X faction sees their flag on display, they'd be more joyful and waste more money. But, if they see a rival faction's, they could drink less or cause a scene and leave. Up to you with different reactions, but I think you could expand the game and lore simultaneously with this system.

It just makes it easier, and you want to reduce the difficulty when starting, so absolutely nothing speaks against actually if your goal is to make your first game.Both engines have their pro's and con's obviously, but be honest, do you want to see your game idea come to live asap or you'd rather struggle for years (learning everything is years, not months), before even anything playable is achieved, just to get demotivated because your idea sucks?
